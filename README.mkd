# Transcode - ImageMagick inspired audio transcoding #
When you need to convert images between formats, it's as easy as

    convert input.png output.jpg

Thanks to image magic. Unfortunately, it is much more difficult to do the same
with audio.

    flac -c -d input.flac | lame -V 0 - output.mp3

Will do the same thing for audio (where png is now flac, and jpeg is now mp3).
This will not take care of metadata (artist, title, album, et cetera), and uses
different switches for each codec, which you would have to look up each time, or
try to memorize. It's evident that this is not a usable solution.

*Transcode* is a simple cli application written in python designed to easily
transcode between audio codecs. The above example becomes as simple as

    transcode input.flac -V 0 output.mp3

That's it, you even keep your metadata!

## Usage ##

    transcode <input file> [options] <output file>

The output format is determined by its extension. `Options` affect how the file
is encoded, for example, with mp3 you can add `-V 0` to encode with the highest
VBR settings.
