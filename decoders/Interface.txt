Modules here should provide:
- HANDLES (list of strings)
- decode(input file, output file)
- getMetadata(input file)

## HANDLES
Is a list of lower case file extensions that this format provides a decoder for.
for example `HANDLES=['flac','fla']`

## decode(input file, output file)
This function takes two arguments, the input file (file name), and the output
file (file name). The function should decode the audio file. The output file
is just a hint, and can freely decode to anywhere.

The function returns the file name that it decoded to, which may (but isn't
necessarily) the same as the second argument. 

## getMetadata(input file)
This function should return as much metadata as possible about the file it is
given as a dictionary. None is required, but should provide as much as possible.

If the format is supported by the program `exiftool`,
`config.readExiftoolMetadata` can be used to get the metadata. Otherwise, this
function should return with the same names that `exiftool` uses.

Namely;
- Title
- Artist
- Album
- Genre
- Track Number
- Tracktotal
- Date
